cassandra_exception_collector
=============================

a script to collect all InvalidRequrestException and their status

This script runs git in shell to checkout tags/branches.

Need to edit `PROJECT_ROOT` in collector.py to point to the path containing cassandra source code.
Edit `list_to_checkout.txt` to add tags/branches you are interested in.
You could find a sample output in `output.txt`.
